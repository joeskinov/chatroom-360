An immersive chatroom in React360(version 1.1). React360 is a javascript based framework that allows you build 3D and VR interfaces. 
This project is a proof of concept I did as part of a much bigger project.

First, you'll need to install React360 by running the following command

     npm install -g react-360-cli

then, clone this project by running the following command

      git clone https://github.com/joeskinov/chatroom-360.git

Finally, enter the project to execute the generated code by running the following command.

      cd Chatroom-360 && npm start Chatroom-360

After this step your program will be running on port 8081(unless specified otherwise in the terminal) and can be visualised in your browser.

I encourage you to create more interfaces and visite React360 official documentation page, https://facebook.github.io/react-360/docs/, for more guidance. Ofcourse, you can fork this project and tweak to your liking for more awsome VR interfaces.
